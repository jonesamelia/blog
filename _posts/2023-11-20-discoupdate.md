Hello! This is another Disco Tray Studios update!
I was not able to work on the games much last week as I performed in a production of the Nutcracker and spent the majority of the week in rehearsals and performances where I was unable to use my laptop. I plan on trying to do a lot of work over the break to make up for it!

For Ground Truth, I could not figure out how to fix the merge conflict so I ended up cloning the repository again and redoing the work I had done on the investigative area. I changed some more and the investigative area should now only use one object! I also fixed the collisions to be the same for all the trees in the river scenes.

In Cadron's Tears, I scripted the map and backpack menus to open upon pressing M or B. I spent a long time scripting that because it was not detecting when the key was pressed. I finally figured out that I was using a script within the menu object which was not alway active. I created a new script and put it on the canvas and now it works!
I also adjusted the new Arkansas Traveller sprite so his hat now blends in with the rest of the sprite. 

Now I plan to finish the maps and work on some other issues!

Thank you for reading, and have a great day!
