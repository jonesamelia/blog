Hello! This is a Disco Tray Studios update! Today we did demos of our two projects. As the only game development person present, I uploaded the newest version of Journey of the Droplet to Itch.io and tested the Faulkner Footsteps app!

The app was great, the images all loaded pretty fast and I didn't have many issues using it. The only thing I saw was an error involving overflow on the screen when I went to log in to the app. When testing the admin thing I also noticed that, when creating or editing a blurb, there is a textbox to input a date, which should probably be a date/time picker thing. Those two things were added as issues. The app looks great!

I watched the others play the game and there weren't any new bugs! In the first level, no one got stuck unable to move after talking to NPCs. In the second level, Colten tried very hard but was no longer able to fly using the vine plant. He also made it to what I assume is the end of the level. We still need to have an end to the level. I think the layout of the second level needs to be adjusted to be a little less difficult. There are also a lot of points where you can not see the platform that you need to jump to next. The camera might need to be farther out.

The only issues I currently have are related to adding NPCs to level two. I also have issues for fixing the vines, but they did not seem to have problems climbing them during the demo and I am not sure how to fix them so I don't know what I will be doing about that.


Thank you for reading my blog post.
