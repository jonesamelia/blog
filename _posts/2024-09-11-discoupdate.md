Hello! This is a Disco Tray Studios update!

Last week, we got the arboretum to .net 8.0! 
I have been working on trying to add the record of when a tree was last updated. I am struggling to add the column to the tree table. I'm not sure how to get the migration to work and add the column... I've been trying to follow the tutorial for migrations, but I keep getting different errors when I try to do database update. I tried some other stuff with no success, and I now get errors when I try to look at the trees on the site. I will continue to try to figure this out.

Thank you for reading my blog post.
