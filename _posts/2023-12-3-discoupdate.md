Hello! This is another Disco Tray Studios update!
Classes have ended!
After the meeting, I spent a lot of time working on Ground Truth and I believe I successfully updated the dialogue system. Pressing E finishes what is being said instead of skipping it and there are now buttons to continue and go back in dialogue! I have not yet made interacting work the same between important NPCs and the ones that you bump into. I will be working on that after finals.
I have really enjoyed working with Disco Tray Studios this semester and I plan to keep working on these games for the rest of December!
