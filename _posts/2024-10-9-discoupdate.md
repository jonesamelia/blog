Hello! This is a Disco Tray Studios update!

I did some stuff for Cadron's Tears!
I spend a while making new animations for the player to move up and down. I then redid the player controller as it was wired strangely. Each state was connected to any state, which caused animations to end halfway through.

I added the movement points to the animals so unity doesn't give errors because of the empty list and animals move around between points again! I also redid each animal's controller so their animations play correctly.

I spent quite some time trying to get the player to stop the walking animation when dialog starts. I eventually fixed that somehow by getting the animator floats to actually be set to 0 when the player is busy.

I added icons that show up on the map at the beginning of each season to tell you who you should speak to first.

Thank you for reading my blog post.
