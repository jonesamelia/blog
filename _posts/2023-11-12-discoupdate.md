Hello! 
This week I have been doing some work on both Ground Truth and Cadron's Tears.
For Ground Truth I fixed the audio so that in the river scene the sound effect for the river gets quieter when the player is father away and I reworked the investigative area so that we do not have separate UIs for before and after the quakes. I also spent some time trying to fix the camera zooming, but it looks like there is currently a pull request fixing that. Today I seem to have done something when trying to merge DiscoTrayStudios onto main and now it is saying that there is a merge conflict on the titlescreen scene and I am not able to load it... I will have to fix that before I can push my changes on the investigative area. 

On Cadron's Tears I made a new sprite for the person at the beginning of the game! I found what was used to create the sprites back in the spring, but it turns out the creator of that sprite maker has removed it from their assets, so I took the sprite from another NPC and adjusted it. I copied over the hat from the original wizard sprite because I thought he needed to keep something from his former self. I also adjusted the size of the portraits during dialogue so they are not stretched.
I also added walking sound effects to the player and bird sounds (from the Ground Truth assets) to the bird in Season 1.
I have also been spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to use a camera to display the map. I have not been able to figure out how to get it to display the whole area or look the way I want it to. I may just return to my original plan of displaying a marker for the location of the player on the map image.

I plan to continue work on the maps and fix my version of Ground Truth so that I can continue to work on it. 

Thank you for reading, and have a great day!
