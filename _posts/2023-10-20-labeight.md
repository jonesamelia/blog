I think I have successfully created a Razor Pages Application for video games! <a href ="https://github.com/jonesamelia/csci340lab8">Here is my repository!</a>

It was pretty easy to create and set up the model and the pages. I was stuck on the seeddata step of the tutorial for a long time as Program.cs would not find SeedData, but it was all because I didn't add .cs to the file name. 

I also had some difficulty getting the search by genre to work (It didn't tell me what was wrong, just would not work) but then I finally realized I had an extra - in one of the lines. 
Most of my confusion was caused by simple mistakes I made when typing the code. 

I found the Razor framework to be a bit more confusing than the Jekyll framework, but much easier to set up... Jekyll had a lot of errors and confusion with ruby and gemfiles. 
Overall, following the tutorial was a good experience and I feel fairly confident that I could make another Razor application!
