It was amazing to work on this project that will be helpful to many members of the Hendrix community! This experience taught me about some of the many ways that computer science can be instrumental in helping to improve peoples' lives. Learning about Hendrix SOS resources as well as all of the other projects that were worked on and presented on in class has inspired me to seek out future opportunities to make a difference through programming.
