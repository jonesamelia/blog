The second client meeting went very well! Christy Coker seemed to like our demo and she gave us useful feedback including information on how the user and admin experiences should be and different kinds of resources that need to be included in the database. I contributed to preparing for the client meeting by helping with the creation of the mockup as well as the pages for the demo.
