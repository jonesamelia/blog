I had fun editing my blog! I had some issues getting a photo to show up on the <a href="https://jonesamelia.github.io/blog/cats/">Cats!</a> page, but I finally got it to work by using the full GitHub address of my image as the link. I just ran into another issue while writing this reflection as this post would not show up on my computer and I could only see it after I pushed it to GitHub. After about 30 minutes, it is now showing up locally.

I'm looking forward to learning Javascript and jQuery in the next <a href="https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/javascript.html">lab!</a>
