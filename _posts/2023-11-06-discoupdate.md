Hello! This is a late update for last week. Today is also my birthday!

Last week I tried to finish the camera zooming feature for Ground Truth and it seemed to mostly work for me, but I think I will be revisiting it and fixing a few other things in the game. 
I have also started working on Cadron's Tears! I spent a while trying to figure out how to make a nice map for the game. I ended up using a paper asset from Ground Truth for the shape of the map. I have added a map for season 1 and soon I will work on creating maps for the other scenes. I also fixed a NPC named John Lemons' sprite and worked on fixing the animal movement in the game so now the fox in season 1 no longer flips around.
This week I will spend some time going back to Ground Truth then I will continue my work on the maps and some other issues for Cadron's Tears.

Thank you for reading, and have a great day!
