Hello! I haven't been posting about Disco Tray like I should have, so I am going to start doing that. I shall post updates every week!


In Disco Tray so far, I have been working on the game Ground Truth, a great game where you are a journalist writing articles and learning about the New Madrid Earthquakes. Some things I have worked on include: improving the dialog system, adding to the intro scene, some updates to the UI, a traveling screen with an animated clock (animating the clock took me quite a while and I was very proud), and ensuring that the game would properly reset when restarted.   

Fall break just ended and I did not get to do much work over the break. 
The thing that I started on last week and am currently working on is adding the second conversation with the editor that plays after the first article is submitted. The editor will say different things to the player depending on how well they did on their last article. I will be finishing that soon and getting it to work with the feedback system, then I will find some other cool things to work on!


We do not have much left to do on Ground Truth, and soon we will start on Cadron's Tears. I was part of the group that worked on Cadron's Tears in the Game Development class in the spring, so that will be fun to visit again!
