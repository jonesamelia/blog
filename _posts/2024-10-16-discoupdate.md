Hello! This is a Disco Tray Studios update!

I did some stuff for Cadron's Tears!
I fixed a few bugs that I had found, but some of them I did not completely resolve. Ones I fixed include the movement of the credits and the fadeout between scenes.

I added buildings to the Season 2 and Season 3 scenes! I used the building tiles from the tileset that our artist gave us. I tried to make one that kind of looks like the blockhouse!

I spent a lot of time working on our project for Mobile Software Development and was not able to finish everything I wanted to get done for Disco Tray, but I plan to do some work over the fall break!

Thank you for reading my blog post.
