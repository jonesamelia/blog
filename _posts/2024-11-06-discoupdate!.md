Hello! This is a Disco Tray Studios update! It is also my birthday! Happy birthday me!

I have been extremely busy and was not able to do very much work on Cadron's Tears this week.

I have worked a bit on the last scene and cutscene, mostly trying to find information and figure out what should happen in the scene. I am not very creative.

.I have started working on making character assets for Osage natives. The character maker that the other characters were made with is no longer onlne, so I am editing the sprites of an existing character, which takes quite a bit of time. 
After that I will incorporate the characters into the scene!


Thank you for reading my blog post.
