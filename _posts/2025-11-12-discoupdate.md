Hello! This is a Disco Tray Studios update! The fall semester is nearly over and I did not successfully write a blog post until now. I am so sorry. I was supposed to write this last week.
This semester has been hectic and I think I might have too much on my plate... With dance team and dance ensemble practices and the seven rehearsals for student dance pieces, it's not going too well. Most days I'm completely busy until 9pm. I have not been able to make a lot of progress on Disco Tray or even on my senior capstone project, which is quite unfortunate. 

Last weekend my time was spent at the ICPC and then with my family. I was not able to do much for Disco Tray, but I hope to make some progress today and this weekend! I am currently still working on some bugs that we found when we tested the game during class last Wednesday.

I am currently working with others on the game Journey of the Droplet! A fun educational platformer! 

I created some platformer obstacles that are plants that the player has to shoot with water to make them grow and be usable. There is a tree that grows to be a platform, a mushroom that becomes a jump pad, and a vine that can be climbed up. 
The vine has some crazy bug that was evident during the playtesting where you could jump just right and start flying... I think it has something to do with the gravity being set to 0 and then the player leaves the vine so it is never set back? It's a bit difficult to test this bug and only one person consistently flew during the testing.
Something I am also trying to fix is an issue with the dialogue script where the player gets stuck unable to move for the whole game, even if they go to the menu and restart, I am still not sure why it does this, but I hope to finish that today. 
I will then work on adding dialogue to the sunflower NPC I added last week! He currently just says hello.

We have also had problems with merge conflicts since we are mostly working on the same scene. Last week I had to redo something I already did because the map overwrote it when a pull request was merged. Apparently there were merge issues with my latest pull request even though it was up to date? I am not sure how that is. 

I hope to actually spend time on Disco Tray this weekend, and hopefully do enough to write another post as well!


Thank you for reading my blog post.
