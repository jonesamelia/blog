Hello! This is a Disco Tray Studios update!

I believe I have successfully added the column to track when a tree was last updated and made a pull request. I did not figure out how to make it update automatically when you edit the tree, which I should probably do. You currently have to select the date when you edit it.

I think next I will try to work on improving the admin page.

Thank you for reading my blog post.
