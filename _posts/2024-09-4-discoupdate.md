Hello! This is a Disco Tray Studios update!

I was unable to do much. I managed to load the Arboretum site but it kept saying that I am not allowed to access the server. It says it can be fixed through the Azure Management Portal, but I do not think I can do that, so I am stuck.

Thank you for reading my blog post.
