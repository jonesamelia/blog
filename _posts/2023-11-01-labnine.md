I have successfully completed lab nine!
I wasn't sure what to name the university so I named it Amelia University... I quickly wanted to name it something else but I didn't want to start over or risk breaking something by trying to rename it.

It was pretty easy to follow the tutorial now that I had some experience with the framework from lab eight. I had some confusion with the handling concurrency conflicts step, but everything was pretty straightforward. I was a bit confused how VS code seemed to constantly show problems and red underlines for no reason. 
The tutorial was fun, and I think this little university database is pretty neat!
