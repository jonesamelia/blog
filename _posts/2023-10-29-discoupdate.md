Hello! I meant to write this post on friday, but my week was cut short by COVID... 

I spent last week drawing more sprites for every NPC in Ground Truth so that they could face each direction instead of just staring straight at the camera while walking sideways like crabs.

The sprites took quite a while to do, but it was fun! I added the sprites to the NPC movement script and now everyone can turn in every direction.

I am now working on scripting it so that the camera zooms in on the NPC when you start talking to them. I have it mostly working, now I just need to make the camera zoom smoothly. 

Next I will start to look at Cadron's Tears and figure out what we need to work on!


Thank you for reading, and have a great day!
