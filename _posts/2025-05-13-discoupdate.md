Hello! This is a Disco Tray Studios update! This is for the entire spring semester. I completely failed to write blog posts.

When the semester started, I worked on Cadron's tears! I added a final scene to the game, fixed some things, and uploaded it to itch.io with nice styling! We did some testing during Disco Tray, I fixed a lot of bugs that were found, and the game was basically complete!

I then started working on the Hendrix Arboretum app, which was fun because I was part of the team that started on it during mobile dev last semester! A lot of progress was made last semester, and there was not much that needed to be done. I made some changes to page sizing and made a logo for the app!  

The main thing that needs to be added is the ability to display the plaques for trees that have them, so I have been working on adding plaques into the arboretum database. The end of my semester was quite hectic, and unfortunately I did not make very much progress on adding the plaques. I had some issues with columns and keys, but I believe I have successfully added plaques to the table! I am still working on making it possible to actually connect the plaques with the trees. The database has a treeplaque table that will store the connected trees and plaques once I figure out how to program.

I look forward to continuing with Disco Tray Studios next semester!     


Thank you for reading my blog post.
